<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository records a deep learning model implemented using 'PyTorch'. This model inputs a JPG image of an everted eyelid and outputs its meiboscore (a measure of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction). The dataset is obtained from a local hospital in Hong Kong which contains 1000 images.

<!-- IMPROVEMENTS -->
## About The Project

Several experiments have been conducted to improve the model:
1. Pre-processing: Use Computer Vision to segment the glands
2. Normalising
